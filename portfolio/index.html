	<p><div style="font-size: 25px; color: white; font-weight: bold;">My name is Shourya. I am a person with a lot of enthusiasm to learn new things and I follow the motto "Live Life to the Fullest".
	I am currently pursuing my B.Tech 3rd Year in CSE stream. During my academic career I had participated in many competitions/events and achieved many prizes. I had participated in my college events every year and I was appreciated for my services as volunteer in my 1st and 2nd years.At the same time I learned the tech information such as resolving problems regarding computer hardware,software,coding ,data visualization, different machine learning algorithms, web development and many more.
	I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.<div>
