	<p><div style="font-size: 25px; color: white; font-weight: bold;">My name is Shourya. I am a person with a lot of enthusiasm to explore new things and I follow the motto "Live Life to the Fullest".
	Currently I am pursuing my B.Tech degree in the stream of Computer Science and Engineering. Other than being good in academics I also love to enhance my co-curricular skills. I have participated in many events/competitions and acheived various prizes. I have also volunteered in several events and was appreciated for my performance every time. I am very serious about my work and would give my best. In the field of technology I have learned a lot about resolving problems regarding computer hardware,software,coding ,data visualization, different machine learning algorithms, web development and many more.
  I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.<div>
